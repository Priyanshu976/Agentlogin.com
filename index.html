            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">The Housing and Urban Development Corporation Limited (HUDCO), a Navratna CPSE under the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs (MoHUA), has been instrumental in shaping India’s socio-economic landscape since its establishment in 1970. Operating with the motto “Profitability with Social Justice,” HUDCO combines financial viability with a commitment to social equity, addressing the housing needs of underserved sections, particularly the Economically Weaker Sections (EWS) and Low-Income Groups (LIG). With its designation as a Non-Banking Financial Company – Infrastructure Finance Company (NBFC-IFC) by the Reserve Bank of India, HUDCO will continue to play a crucial role in sustainable asset creation, contributing to the vision of a ‘Viksit Bharat’.</p>
            <br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;">With an authorized capital of Rs. 2,500 crore, HUDCO currently has a paid-up equity of Rs. 2,001.90 crore. The registered and corporate office of the company is located in New Delhi with 21 regional offices and 11 development offices across India. It has a dedicated training and research arm, the Human Settlement Management Institute (HSMI), also in New Delhi.</p>
